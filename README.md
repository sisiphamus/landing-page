# Pepper Landing Page

The marketing site for Pepper, my AI personal assistant.

Pepper is an AI system I built that bridges messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS) to Claude, letting me run complex tasks from my phone. This is the public-facing page that explains what it does and why it exists.

## What's Here

A dark-mode SaaS-style landing page featuring:

- **Gradient hero** with a radial glow effect and pulsing green "online" indicator showing Pepper is always running
- **Channel strip** showing all the platforms Pepper integrates with
- **Feature cards** with hover-lift effects explaining core capabilities
- **Pipeline visualization** walking through how Pepper processes a request step by step (from message receipt through task classification, memory retrieval, execution, and response delivery)
- **Chat demo mockup** showing a real interaction flow
- **Dark aesthetic** with orange accent gradients on near-black backgrounds

## Design Choices

The dark mode with orange accents is intentional. Pepper runs in the background, always on, always listening. The dark UI reflects that persistent, ambient nature. The pipeline visualization is the most important section because it shows the actual intelligence behind the system, not just "it's an AI chatbot."

## Tech

Single HTML file, pure CSS (no Tailwind, no framework), vanilla CSS animations. Zero external dependencies. Open it and it works.
