# Pepper

Single HTML file. Zero dependencies. This is the marketing page for Pepper, my AI personal assistant.

Dark-mode SaaS layout: gradient hero section with a pulsing green "online" dot, feature cards with hover-lift effects, a chat demo mockup, and orange accents on near-black. All pure CSS -- no libraries, no build, nothing to install.

The section worth looking at is the pipeline visualization. Instead of the usual "it understands you!" chatbot marketing, this breaks down the actual intelligence architecture: message receipt, classification, memory lookup, execution, response. Five discrete stages rendered as a horizontal flow. It shows *how Pepper thinks*, not just that it talks. That distinction is the whole page's thesis.

`index.html` -- open it.
